    <p>
      I have a deep appreciation for mathematics and find beauty in its logical
      structures and problem-solving approaches. This mathematical mindset helps
      me approach programming challenges with analytical thinking.
    </p>

    <p>
      My technical interests include web development and computer graphics. I
      enjoy creating interactive experiences and exploring the intersection of
      code and visual design.

    <h2 id="hobbies-heading">Hobbies</h2>
    <p>When I'm not working, you'll find me:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Coding</strong> - Working on personal projects and exploring new
        technologies
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Reading about coding</strong> - Staying up-to-date with development
        trends and best practices
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Linux ricing</strong> - Customizing and optimizing my Linux desktop
        environment
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Customizing Neovim</strong> - Fine-tuning my development environment
        for maximum productivity
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>Factory games</strong> - Playing automation and building games like:
        <ul>
          <li>Satisfactory</li>

      enjoyable.
