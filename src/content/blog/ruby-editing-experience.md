Why is ruby problematic



My personal problems
* jump to gem (library code)
* view schema file
* jump between controller/view/model
* factory/shared context/ let binding
* translations
* autocompletion (attributes)

* demo videos


questions


```
Tell me about solargraph.

Can i combine it with ruby_lsp?

Does ruby lsp use YARD

Does solargraph parse schema.rb?
```


* ruby_lsp vs solargraph table

What i end up with
vim-rails
demo for factory jumping / view jumping

Example bundled
