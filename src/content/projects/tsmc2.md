# TSMC2

This is probably the project I spent most of my free time on. There have been many iterations:

1. [Minecraft Clone](https://github.com/CuddlyBunion341/minecraft-clone): Simple infinite terrain, hacky, chaotic code written in JavaScript
2. [TS-MC](https://github.com/CuddlyBunion341/ts-mc): A rewrite of Minecraft Clone in TypeScript, better code structure, functional hotbar, water, sand physics, hacky collisions
3. [TSMC2](https://github.com/CuddlyBunion341/tsmc2): A more sophisticated codebase in TypeScript, multithreading with Webworkers, custom shaders with GLSL, better defined workflow with Pull Requests, attempt at integrating rust with WASM to improve terrain generation performance.
4. [RSMC](https://github.com/CuddlyBunion341/rsmc): A Minecraft clone written entirely in Rust, in a very early stage with focus on Multiplayer and performance.

Make sure to check out [the blog post](/blog/exploring-rust) for more details about the rust project.
Also feel free to checkout the pull requests for mind-maps, documentation and demo showcases.
